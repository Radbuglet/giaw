# Game In A While

This is a simple Rust project to challenge myself to write a game in a ~~week~~ while. In addition to the wonderful fun afforded by a tight deadline, my hope with this project is that its deadline will force me to design a convenient albeit under-optimized game-making foundation from which more thought-out projects such as Crucible may take inspiration.
